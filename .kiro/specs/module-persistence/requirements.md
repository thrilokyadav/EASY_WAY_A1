# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The bolt automation app currently has functional frontend components for managing modules (add, edit, delete) but lacks proper persistence. Modules are stored only in frontend state using preset data, causing all changes to be lost on page refresh. This feature will implement proper database persistence to make the app production-ready by ensuring modules are saved, retrieved, and managed through a backend API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my custom modules to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't lose my work when I refresh the page or close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a new module THEN the system SHALL save the module to the database and return the saved module with a unique ID
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved modules from the database
3. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL display all previously created modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing modules and have those changes saved permanently, so that my modifications are not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits a module THEN the system SHALL update the module in the database with the new information
2. WHEN a user edits a module THEN the system SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp
3. WHEN a module is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the changes immediately in the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete modules permanently, so that I can remove modules I no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes a module THEN the system SHALL remove the module from the database
2. WHEN a module is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from the UI immediately
3. IF the deleted module was currently selected THEN the system SHALL clear the selection and reset the input/output areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to have proper error handling for database operations, so that users get meaningful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate offline message
3. WHEN a module operation fails THEN the system SHALL not update the UI state until the operation succeeds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load quickly on startup, so that I can begin working without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load modules from the database within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN modules are loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. WHEN module loading fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and allow retry
